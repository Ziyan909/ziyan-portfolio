<h1>Secure Password Vault</h1>

<h2>Why password storage is dangerous</h2>
<p>
Most cyber attacks begin with stolen or reused credentials.
If one site leaks a password, attackers try the same password on
email, banking, and cloud accounts. This is called credential stuffing.
</p>

<h2>How the vault protects credentials</h2>
<p>
The vault never stores your master password. Instead, it uses PBKDF2
to derive a strong encryption key from it. All saved passwords are then
encrypted using AES-256-GCM, which provides both confidentiality and
tamper detection.
</p>

<h2>Why AES-256-GCM matters</h2>
<p>
AES-GCM ensures that encrypted data cannot be modified without being
detected. This protects the vault from silent corruption, malware
tampering, and data injection attacks.
</p>

<h2>What an attacker sees</h2>
<p>
If an attacker steals the vault file, they see only random encrypted
bytes. Without the master password, decrypting the data is
computationally infeasible.
</p>

<h2>Security impact</h2>
<p>
This vault prevents credential theft, reduces breach damage, and enforces
proper cryptographic storage of secrets. It reflects how professional
password managers work internally.
