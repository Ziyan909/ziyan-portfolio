<h1>How Open Ports Get Exploited</h1>
<p><strong>Project:</strong> Sentinel Port Scanner<br>
<strong>Author:</strong> ZIYAN</p>

<h2>What is an open port?</h2>
<p>
Every device connected to a network exposes ports that allow services to run.
Port 22 is usually SSH, 80 is web servers, 3306 is databases, and so on.
When a port is open, it means a service is listening and waiting for connections.
</p>

<h2>How attackers find open ports</h2>
<p>
Attackers never guess. They use automated tools like Nmap and Masscan to scan
thousands of ports on a target. If a port replies, it means a service exists.
This step is called reconnaissance.
</p>

<h2>What happens after a port is discovered</h2>
<p>
Once an attacker knows which ports are open, they start attacking the service behind it.
For example, SSH ports are brute-forced, web servers are exploited, and database ports
are targeted for data theft.
</p>

<h2>How Sentinel Port Scanner works</h2>
<p>
My Port Scanner performs the same discovery process, but for defense. It sends TCP
probes to common ports and logs which services are exposed. This allows a defender
to see their attack surface before attackers do.
</p>

<h2>Security impact</h2>
<p>
Most real-world breaches begin with an open, forgotten port. By identifying and
closing unnecessary ports, organizations reduce their risk dramatically.
